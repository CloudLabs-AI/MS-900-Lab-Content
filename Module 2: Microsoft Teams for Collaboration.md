  Microsoft Teams is a collaboration app that helps your team stay organized and have conversations—all in one place. With Microsoft Teams on your PC, Mac, or mobile device, you  can :
  
   * Pull together a team.
   * Use chat instead of email.
   * Securely edit files at the same time.
   * See likes, @mentions, and replies with just a single tap.
   * Customize it by adding notes, web sites, and apps.
